Uncharted Realms is a collectible card game based around its very own neural network. All cards in the game are generated by the neural net, from card stats to name and image. As players pick cards, the neural net uses that pick information to balance the cards further and create continuously unique experiences.

## How to run! 
Start server using
```
> python3 server.py
```
While the server is running, open the web client using the instructions on the web client repository.

## How it's built it
The neural network for generating cards is built using Scikit Learn. A linear regression is created by fitting the stats of existing cards against their cost. Numerical values have a simple linear fit, but more complex stats like specific words had to be turn into numerical representations called "one hot". Cards were then generated for users to play games with, and these cards were then sent back to the network and were used to retrain the network and improve its confidence.
